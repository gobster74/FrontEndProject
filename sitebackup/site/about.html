                <h2>Career Beginnings</h2>
                <h3> In Nashville, Taylor started working with songwriter Liz Rose during two-hour writing sessions
                    every Tuesday afternoon after school. Later, she became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV
                    publishing house, but left the group at age 14. She believed she was running out of time because she
                    wanted to capture the early years of her life on an album while it still represented what she was
                    going through.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        At a showcase in Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a
                    record executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She
                    became one of Big Machine's first signings, with her father purchasing a three percent share of the
                    company.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        Taylor then started working on her debut album and persuaded Big Machine to hire Nathan Chapman to
                    produce her songs. Her first lead single “Tim McGraw” was released in June 2006, and Taylor Swift’s
                    self titled album was released later that year, on October 24, 2006. It peaked at number 5 on the US
                    Billboard 200, where it spent 275 weeks. Swift was also the opening act for Brad Paisley’s 2007 tour
                    to promote her album and spent 2006 and 2007 doing promotion on radios, television, and being the
                    opening act for country artists in the US. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Taylor released four more
                    singles from her debut album and all of them appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart.
                    Swift released her first two EPs "The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection" and "Beautiful Eyes" in
                    October 2007 and July 2008, respectively, winning accolades for all of her first three projects.
                    She became the youngest person to be honored with the BMI Songwriter of the Year title in 2007. She
                    won awards at the CMAs, ACMs and AMAs while also securing a nomination for Best New Artist at the
                    50th Grammy Awards.

                <h2>Speak Now</h2>
                <h3> In August 2010, Swift released "Mine”, the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now. It
                    debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at number three. Following criticism claiming Taylor’s
                    songwriting was good because she worked with co-writers, Swift wrote all 17 tracks on her third
                    record by herself as well as co-produced every song.
                    The album was released on October 25, 2010, debuting at number 1 on Billboard 200, with 1 million
                    copies sold in its first week.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        At the 54th Grammy Awards, in 2012, Swift won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance
                    for "Mean", which she performed during the ceremony in response to her much criticized 2010 Grammy
                    performance, serving as a testament to her abilities as a musician.
                    Swift won several awards for Speak Now, including Songwriter of the Year at the BMI Awards,
                    Entertainer of the Year at the ACMs and CMAs, and was named Billboard’s Woman of the Year. The album
                    also received general acclaim from critics, with Rolling Stone praising Taylor abilities as a
                    rockstar.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>

                    & Sound”, recorded with The Civil Wars. The latter went on to win a Grammy award as well as a Golden
                    Globe nomination. Taylor was featured on BoB's single "Both of Us”, released in May 2012.

                <h2>Reputation</h2>
                <h3> After disappearing from social media and the public eye during most of 2016, Swift executed one of
                    the most successful comebacks in history with her sixth studio album, reputation. “Look What You
                    Made Me Do” was released as the albums’s lead single and its music video broke the record for the

                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        The album was released on November 10, 2017 and incorporated a heavy electropop sound, with hip hop,

                    the US top-five entry "...Ready for It?".
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        In support of reputation, she embarked on her reputation Stadium Tour, which ran from May to

                        tickets, breaking Swift's own record for the highest-grossing US tour by a woman, which was
                        previously held by her 1989 World Tour ($181.5 million). It also became the highest-grossing North
                        American concert tour in history. Worldwide, the tour grossed $345.7 million. On December 31st,

                <h3> On July 23, 2020, Swift surprise-announced she would be releasing her eighth studio album,
                    folklore, at midnight. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 and became the year's
                    longest-running no. 1, with 8 non-consecutive weeks at the top of the chart. The album’s lead single
                    “cardigan” also debuted at #1.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        Made in isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, folklore was the result of a collaboration with
                    long-time musical partner Jack Antonoff, Aaron Dessner, from The National, with whom Taylor had
                    never worked before, and Bon Iver who are featured in one of the album’s tracks.
                    In November 2020, Swift released the self-directed “folklore: the long pond studio sessions” on
                    Disney+, a documentary in which Taylor, Aaron and Jack perform all the songs from the record while
                    discussing the meanings and inspirations behind the album.
                    Folklore earned Swift 5 nominations at the Grammys, including Album and Song of the Year. Taylor won
                    the Album of the Year statue, becoming the first woman to win the Grammy’s highest honor three
                    times.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        On December 10, 2020, Swift once again surprised her fans with the announcement of her ninth studio
                    album and folklore’s sister record, evermore. The album was released on the 11th and continued
                    Taylor’s collaborations with Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff and Bon Iver, as well as incorporated new
                    artists into the “folkmore universe”, such as HAIM and The National. Both evermore and its lead
                    single “willow” debuted atop of the Hot 100 and Billboard 200 charts. Having both sister albums
                    achieve this feature, Swift became the first artist to debut at the top of both the singles and
                    albums charts simultaneously twice.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>
                        Folklore and Evermore embrace an indie folk and alternative rock production, a departure from
                    Swift’s previous upbeat pop releases. Both albums sold over one million units worldwide in its first
                    week and folklore broke the record for first-day album streams by a female artist on Spotify.
                    Taylor began working on the re-recordings of her first 6 studio albums in November of last year. The
                    first release from this effort to own her catalog was the re-recording of her sophomore album
                    Fearless, now Fearless (Taylor’s Version). It was released on April 9, 2021 and included 6 never
                    before heard songs that didn’t make it into the album originally, besides the 20 tracks that had
                    already been released in 2008 and 2009. Fearless (Taylor’s Version) debuted at #1 on the Billboard
                    Hot 200, becoming Swift’s 9th consecutive album and the first re-recorded album in history to do so.
                    Taylor announced she will be releasing the re-recording of her 4th studio album, RED, on November
                    19, 2021.
